CS3700: Project 0

Due to the simplicity of this project the main design decision we made
was to write in C. Although this added some complexity to the project,
we felt that it helped give us a better lower level understanding of what 
was happening.

The major challenge we faced was parsing string in C, which turned out to 
be a bit messy.
